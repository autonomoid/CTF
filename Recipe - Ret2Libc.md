Here’s a concise strategy or “recipe” to tackle **Prototype Pollution** leading to **XSS** in a Capture the Flag (CTF) competition. This assumes familiarity with JavaScript and web security concepts.

### 1. **Recognize the Challenge Setup**
   - **Prototype Pollution**: Involves injecting properties into an object’s prototype, which can modify behavior globally in JavaScript.
   - **Gadget to XSS**: Refers to finding a vulnerable piece of code (gadget) that uses the polluted property and executes malicious input, leading to **XSS** (Cross-Site Scripting).

### 2. **Identify the Entry Points**
   - **JavaScript Objects**: Check where objects are extended/modified, particularly functions like `Object.assign()`, `$.extend()`, `_.merge()`, etc.
   - **User Input**: Trace the flow of user input into object properties or their prototypes.

### 3. **Polluting the Prototype**
   - **Inject Malicious Property**: Use input vectors to inject into `Object.prototype`. Common payload:
     ```javascript
     ?__proto__[polluted_property]=malicious_value
     ```
   - **Common Polluted Properties**: Aim for modifying properties like:
     - `constructor`
     - `__proto__`
     - Any globally used attributes (e.g., `toString`, `valueOf`).

### 4. **Find the Gadget**
   - A **gadget** is a piece of JavaScript code that **uses the polluted property**. You want to find code that uses dynamic properties which can be controlled.
   - Look for:
     - `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `eval()`, `setTimeout()`, `document.write()`—any function that processes or injects content into the DOM.
   - Inspect the JavaScript files for any such dynamic code where your polluted properties may be used.

### 5. **Craft an XSS Payload**
   - Once you find a gadget, inject an XSS payload through prototype pollution.
     Example:
     ```javascript
     ?__proto__[innerHTML]=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
     ```

### 6. **Test for Exploitation**
   - **Step-by-Step Approach**:
     1. Identify a point where user input is used to update an object.
     2. Inject a malicious property like `__proto__[innerHTML]` or `constructor`.
     3. Check if the property gets reflected in the DOM or executed.

### 7. **Automation (If Allowed)**
   - **Script the Exploit**: Use a quick browser script or a simple Python exploit to automate pollution and payload injection to save time during the competition.
     ```python
     import requests

     target_url = "http://example.com/vulnerable_page"
     payload = "?__proto__[innerHTML]=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"

     # Send the exploit request
     requests.get(target_url + payload)
     ```

### 8. **Common Pitfalls**
   - **CSP (Content Security Policy)**: If a CSP is in place, traditional XSS payloads might be blocked. Look for bypass techniques like using inline styles (`<svg/onload=alert(1)>`) or other gadgets.
   - **Sanitization**: Be aware of sanitization functions; some may still allow prototype pollution while filtering direct payloads.

### 9. **Real-Time Debugging**
   - Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to quickly inspect how your inputs are reflected in the page’s JavaScript or DOM.

### 10. **Exploit Templates for Quick Reference**
   - **Prototype Injection Payload**:
     ```http
     ?__proto__[key]=value
     ```
   - **XSS Payload**:
     ```javascript
     ?__proto__[innerHTML]=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
     ```

### Conclusion

Prototype pollution to XSS challenges require finding points where user input can be injected into JavaScript object prototypes and then locating a gadget that executes or reflects that input into the DOM. The key is to stay systematic: **identify pollution points**, **locate the gadget**, and **craft a proper XSS payload**.
